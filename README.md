# Frusion
# Video Demo:
#### Description:
Frusion is a 2D game made in the Godot engine where you drop fruit into a bucket and attempt to fuse fruit together into a larger fruit by getting 2 of the same size of fruit to touch. The bigger the fusion 
the more points you get! Try to get the most amount of points before the bucket overflows with fruit. Use your mouse to move around and choose where you want
to drop your fruits to fuse as many as possible.

# Scenes:
	
### Main:
This scene is the one you see when you press play.
I used stock wall sprite assets from Godot to make a bunch of wall sprites. Then I arranged the walls to make a cube without the top (bucket). After that I simply added collision boxes for each wall to prevent the fruit from “falling through”. I also added text labels to display the losing message and the score counter
### Grape:
This scene is the smallest fruit in the game (index position 0 in fruit_types) and can only be spawned in the dropper
### Strawberry:
This scene is the 2nd smallest fruit in the game (index position 1 in fruit_types) and can be spawned in the dropper or when 2 grapes fuse
### Orange:
This scene is the 2nd largest fruit in the game (index position 2 in fruit_types) and can only be spawned when 2 strawberries fuse
### Watermelon:
This scene is the largest fruit in the game (index position 3 in fruit_types) and can only be spawned when 2 oranges fuse\


# Scripting:

### Main:
This script controls the main scene which is the one you see when you press play. As a whole it handles the spawning of fruits, the dropping of those fruits,
the spawning of the new fused fruits, and the game over when the bucket is filled.

**Line 1:**\
Extends the main node which just means that this script applies to the main scene.
```
extends Node
```

**Lines 4-7:**\
Exports all of our fruits as "PackedScene" which means that we can create multiple instances of the same scene, meaning we can make multiple copies
of the same fruit.
```
@export var Grape: PackedScene
@export var Strawberry: PackedScene
@export var Orange: PackedScene
@export var Watermelon: PackedScene
```

**Lines 10-11:**\
Creates fruit_types list variable which contains all of the fruit types\
Creates the new_fruit variable which randomly selects a fruit from fruit_types to be the first fruit spawned 
```
@onready var fruit_types = [Grape,Strawberry,Orange,Watermelon]
@onready var new_fruit = fruit_types[randi() % (fruit_types.size() - 2)].instantiate()
```

**Lines 14-15:**\
Creates is_ready variable to prevent a function from being called again while the previous call is still ongoing\
Creates is_following_mouse variable to handle when fruits should follow the mouse cursor and when then should drop normally
```
@onready var is_ready = true
var is_following_mouse = true
```

**Lines 18-19:**\
Creates score variable to count score\
Creates score_path variable to hold the filepath to the score label on the 2D model of the main scene
```
@onready var score = 0
@onready var score_path = get_node("/root/Main/Score")
```

**Line 22:**\
Called whenever an input event occurs and passes an event variable that returns the input type and related information
```
func _input(_event):
```

**Line 25:**\
Runs the function if the player clicks and the previous function call has finished (is_ready = true)
```
	if Input.is_action_pressed("click") and is_ready == true:
```

**Lines 28:**\
Set is_ready to false since now function call is in progress
```
		#Set check variable to false to prevent concurrent calls
		is_ready = false
```

**Lines 31-32:**\
Turns off mouse following\
Drops the current fruit 
```
		is_following_mouse = false
		new_fruit.gravity_scale = 1.0
```

**Lines 35-37:**\
Creates new fruit in the dropper (not spawned yet)\
Turns off falling 
```
		#Creates new fruit 
		var next_fruit = fruit_types[randi() % (fruit_types.size() - 2)]
		new_fruit = next_fruit.instantiate()
		new_fruit.gravity_scale = 0.0
```

**Line 40:**\
Wait for 0.7 seconds for previous fruit to finish falling so it doesn't collide with the new fruit when we spawn the new fruit in 
```
		#Wait for 0.7 seconds for previous fruit to finish falling
		await get_tree().create_timer(0.7).timeout
```

**Lines 44-46:**\
Make the the new fruit invisible and set it to follow the mouse before finally spawning it in
```
		#Make the new fruit invisible and set 
		#to follow mouse before spawning in new fruit
		new_fruit.hide()
		is_following_mouse = true
		add_child(new_fruit)
```

**Lines 51-52:**\
Wait for brief moment to allow the new fruit to lock onto mouse position before making the fruit visible to prevent "motion blur" effect
```
		await get_tree().create_timer(0.005).timeout
		new_fruit.set_visible(true)
```

**Lines 55:**\
Set is_ready back to true since now the function call is finished
```
		#Now function is ready to be called again
		is_ready = true
```

**Lines 58-62:**\
Function for spawning the "fused fruits"
```
func spawn_fruit(type, pos, scoring):
	var fruit = fruit_types[type].instantiate()
	fruit.position = pos
	fruit.gravity_scale = 1.0
	add_child.call_deferred(fruit)
```

**Lines 65-66:**\
Adding to the score for successful fusions
```
	#Adding score for sucessful fusions
	score += scoring
	score_path.set_text("Score: " + str(score))
```
