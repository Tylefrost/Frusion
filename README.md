# Frusion
### Video Demo:
### Description:
Frusion is a game where you drop fruit into a bucket and attempt to fuse fruit together by getting 2 of the same size of fruit to touch. The bigger the fusion 
the more points you get! Try to get the most amount of fusion points before the bucket overfills with fruit.
### 2D Models:
I used stock sprite assets from Godot to make the sprite images for the bucket and fruits. Then I simply added collision boxes for each object
I only changed the sizes of the balls to indicate the different types of fruit. After that it was just adding text labels to display the losing message
and the score counter
